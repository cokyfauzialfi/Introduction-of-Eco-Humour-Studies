                explanation: "Greek comedy engaged the natural world not as backdrop, but as a site of ideological contest and comic invention (Revermann, 2014), making nature central to the theatrical imagination rather than peripheral."

                explanation: "River gods functioned as comic personifications and political statements with gendered bodies, including explicitly sexualized comedy through features like penile water emissions. These were witty, if indecorous, representations within Katharine Park's 'regime of plenty' (Lazzaro, 2011)."

                explanation: "Northrop Frye observed that Shakespeare's romantic comedies manifest a movement from the normal world into 'the green world,' where problems of the ordinary world dissolve (Abshavi, 2014), revealing an understanding that natural environments were morally superior to urban spaces."

                explanation: "Swift's Gulliver's Travels portrayed the Academy of Lagado showing absurd agricultural 'improvements' that left the land barren, serving as implicit critique of instrumentalist approaches to nature and establishing a template for environmental satire (Bullard, 2025)."
